How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side, I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat it's all I ever

I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up and brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back
I gotta take it on the other side

Centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I marry the sea
Stranger things could never change my mind
I gotta take it on the other side
Take it on the other side
Take it on, take it on

How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side, I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat it's all I ever

Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full and I'm spillin' my guts
She wants to know, am I still a slut?
I've got to take it on the other side
